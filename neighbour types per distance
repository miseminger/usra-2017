#files are 1600px wide by 1200px tall
Types of cell neighbours present at front vs. back of cluster over time: show with a plot of average \# of red-red, green-green and red-green over all clusters (with stdev) vs. time
\item {\bf February 23}: Velocity vs. time in front vs. back of cluster (leading vs. trailing edge), averaged over all clusters (*Heteromotility package?)
