adapt the csv for neighbours to include cell positions and velocities

#for now, assume the cells are all moving in the x direction
#find the cell furthest to the right
#take all cells with x values from the furthest right to distance d to the left of it
#have the option to take several (n) strips of cells: total cell group width/n
#for each strip, labeled 1,2,3,4,...,n, find the neighbours
